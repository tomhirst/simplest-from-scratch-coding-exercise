# Simplest from scratch coding exercise

This is the simplest from scratch coding exercise to answer "What's the best way to learn to code if you know nothing?".

The goal is to create a simple web page that displays the text "Hello World!".

The page should be valid HTML5 and should be styled with CSS.

The page should be built from scratch, without using any frameworks or libraries.

Play around by adding [HTML elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp) and [CSS styles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference).
